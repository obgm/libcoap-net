<span class="strong"><strong>-lcoap-2-openssl</strong></span> or
<span class="strong"><strong>-lcoap-2-tinydtls</strong></span> depending on your (D)TLS library
type.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a id="_description"></a><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p>This man page focuses on setting up CoAP to use encryption.</p><p>When the libcoap library was built, it will have been compiled using a
specific underlying TLS implementation type (e.g. OpenSSL, GnuTLS, TinyDTLS or
noTLS).  When the libcoap library is linked into an application, it is possible
that the application needs to dynamically determine whether DTLS or TLS is
supported, what type of TLS implementation libcoap was compiled with, as well
as detect what is the version of the currently loaded TLS library.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If OpenSSL is being used, then the minimum supported OpenSSL library
version is 1.1.0.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If GnuTLS is being used, then the minimum GnuTLS library version is
3.3.0.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If GnuTLS is going to interoperate with TinyDTLS, then a minimum
revision of GnuTLS 3.5.5 which supports CCM algorithms is required
by TinyDTLS as TinyDTLS currently only supports CCM.</p><p>Network traffic can be un-encrypted or encrypted with libcoap if there is an
underlying TLS library.</p><p>If TLS is going to be used for encrypting the network traffic, then the TLS
information for Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) needs
to be configured before any network traffic starts to flow. For Servers, this
has to be done before the Endpoint is created, for Clients, this is done
during the Client Session set up.</p><p>For Servers, all the encryption information is held internally by the TLS
Context level and the CoAP Context level as the Server is listening for new
incoming traffic based on the Endpoint definition.  The TLS and CoAP session
will not get built until the new traffic starts, which is done by the libcoap
library, with the session having a reference count of 1.</p><p>For Clients, all the encryption information can be held at the TLS Context and
CoAP Context levels, or usually at the TLS Session and CoAP Session levels.  If
defined at the Context level, then when Sessions are created, they will
inherit the Context definitions, unless they have separately been defined for
the Session level, in which case the Session version will get used.
Typically the information will be configured at the Session level for Clients.</p><p>In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Servers looks like</p><pre class="screen">coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_context_set_pki() and/or coap_context_set_psk() - if encryption is required
coap_new_endpoint()</pre><p>Multiple endpoints can be set up per Context, each listening for a new traffic
flow with different TCP/UDP protocols, TLS protocols, port numbers etc. When a
new traffic flow is started, then the CoAP library will create and start a new
server session.</p><p>In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Clients looks like</p><pre class="screen">coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_new_client_session(), coap_new_client_session_pki() or coap_new_client_session_psk()</pre><p>Multiple client sessions are supported per Context.</p><p>Due to the nature of TLS, there are Callbacks that are invoked as the TLS
session negotiates encryption algorithms, encryption keys etc.
Where possible, the CoAP layer handles all this automatically based on
different configuration options passed in by the coap_*_pki() functions.</p><p>For PSK setup, the required information needs to be provided in the setup
calls with no application Callbacks required. Both the Client and Server have
to provide a PSK.  The Server must have a Hint defined and the Client must
have an Identity defined.</p><p>For PKI setup, if the libcoap PKI configuration options do not handle a specific
requirement as defined by the available options, then an application defined
Callback can called to do the additional specific checks.</p><p>The information passed to this Application Callback will be the
TLS session (as well the configuration information), but the structures
containing this information will be different as they will be based on the
underlying TLS library type. coap_get_tls_library_version() is provided to help
here.</p><p>Libcoap will add in the defined Certificate, Private Key and CA Certificate
into the TLS environment.  The CA Certificate is also added in to the list of
valid CAs for Certificate checking.</p><p>The internal Callbacks (and optionally the Application Callback) will then
check the required information as defined in the coap_dtls_pki_t described
below.</p><pre class="programlisting">typedef struct coap_dtls_pki_t {
